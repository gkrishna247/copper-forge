# Copper-Forge

**Optimizing sales & pricing in the copper industry with machine learning (Work in Progress)**

This project is currently under development and aims to utilize machine learning for predicting copper selling prices and classifying sales leads. This README will be updated as the project progresses.

## Project Overview

The goal of Copper-Forge is to address two main challenges within the copper industry:

* **Price Prediction:** Develop a regression model to predict copper selling prices based on various influencing factors.
* **Lead Classification:** Build a classification model to predict the likelihood of converting sales leads.

## Planned Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization techniques will be explored.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features to potentially improve model performance.
* **Model Building:** Exploration and implementation of suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, others).
* **Streamlit App:** Development of an interactive Streamlit application for data visualization and making predictions.


## Dataset

The dataset for this project is still being finalized and will be linked here once available.


## Project Status & Next Steps

Currently focusing on:

* [ ] Data acquisition and initial exploration
* [ ] Defining the scope of feature engineering

Next steps:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Model selection and training
* Building the Streamlit app

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome as the project progresses.  Check back for updates on how to get involved.
